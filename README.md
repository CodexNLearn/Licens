# Licens
This license (named Licens) allows the user to:
- Use the object
- Distribute the object

Licens obligate the user to:
- Credit the owner of the object at a VISIBLE place (so not just a comment in the code etc.)
- Include this license file in the object (or a link to it)
- The user must keep these rules
- If the object is a re-distributed object, the user must include all of the distributers

Licens prohibit the user from:
- Distributing the object without credit
- Use the object's more than third part with not crediting the distributer
